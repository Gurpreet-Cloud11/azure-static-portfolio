# 🚀 My First Static Website Hosted on Azure

This is a simple static website I created and deployed using **Azure Blob Storage** as part of my journey to become a Cloud Solutions Architect.

## 📌 Why I Built This

I wanted hands-on experience with cloud services and to show I can deploy something real. This is my first step into building real-world cloud projects.
